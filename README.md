The book seems to be a unique book to talk about deep-learning domain using functional programming languages. It tries to demonstract how general purpose functional programming can be used to model distinct domains.

While the book is using Racket (a modern dialect of scheme), this repo contains my implementations in OCaml and various reading notes.
